        <h2>1. Importance of Crop Rotation</h2>
        <p>Crop rotation helps maintain soil fertility and reduces soil erosion. By rotating crops such as legumes, cereals, and root vegetables, farmers can naturally restore nutrients in the soil and break pest and disease cycles.</p>

        <h2>2. Organic Fertilizers vs Chemical Fertilizers</h2>
        <p>Organic fertilizers, like compost and manure, release nutrients slowly and improve soil structure over time. Chemical fertilizers offer immediate nutrient boosts but may degrade soil quality if overused. A balanced approach often yields the best results.</p>

        <h2>3. Water-Saving Irrigation Techniques</h2>
        <p>Drip irrigation and sprinkler systems are effective methods for conserving water in agriculture. These techniques ensure that water reaches plant roots directly, minimizing evaporation and water waste.</p>

        <h2>4. Pest Control Using Natural Methods</h2>
        <p>Introducing natural predators like ladybugs and using neem oil can help control pests without harming the environment. Crop interplanting is another strategy that confuses pests and reduces infestation.</p>

        <h2>5. Post-Harvest Storage Tips</h2>
        <p>Proper drying, cleaning, and storage in cool, dry places can significantly reduce post-harvest losses. Use airtight containers and monitor for moisture to prevent mold and pest infestation.</p>
